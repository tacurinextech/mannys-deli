              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                {`${config.COMPANY.NAME} was founded in 2014 by Rolando Tacuri, a chef with a bold vision to bring the vibrant 
                flavors of Latin America together under one roof. Born in Ecuador and trained alongside cooks from across 
                the region, Rolando developed a deep appreciation for the unique culinary traditions of each country. From Ecuadorâ€™s 
                coastal ceviches to the savory pernil dishes of Puerto Rico, each flavor left its mark.`}

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                {`What started as a small Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican deli soon grew into something much more. Rolando brought together 
                a team of talented cooks from places like Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and beyond. The result is a menu that celebrates 
                the best of each culture and offers something truly special. Every dish has a story and brings a taste of Latin America's 
                rich diversity, all with a comforting, homemade touch.`}
